KingOfDeer
==========
This was the first game I ever made back in highschool. Most of the sprite are not my own but are taken from
the public domain. I used a series of youtube videos to guide me in my game making journey. This is the final 
product. Although, it is a bit shabby.

Running The Game
===========
To run the game on your local machine you need to download the res folder and the executable jar file entitled KingOfDeer.jar Once downloaded make sure both the jar file and the res folder are found in the same directory then simply run the jar.
